# System Context for Collaborative Document System

## 1. Architecture Overview

### Microservices
- **UserService**: Manages user registration, authentication, profiles, and permissions.
- **DocumentService**: Handles document CRUD operations, versioning, and storage.
- **CollaborationService**: Manages real-time collaboration, editing sessions, and conflict resolution.

### Communication
- **REST APIs**: For standard CRUD and service-to-service communication.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time document collaboration and updates.

### Data
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store for persistent data (users, documents, permissions).
- **Redis**: Used for caching frequently accessed data and as a message broker for real-time collaboration events.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Cache/Message Broker**: Redis
- **Real-time**: WebSockets (via FastAPI)

## 2. Development Standards

### Code Structure and Patterns
- Follow a modular, service-oriented architecture.
- Use repository and service layers for business logic separation.
- Adhere to PEP8 for Python code style.
- Organize code into `routers`, `models`, `schemas`, `services`, and `tests` directories.

### Error Handling Conventions
- Use FastAPI's exception handlers for consistent error responses.
- Return HTTP status codes and error messages in a standard format:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": {
      "code": "ERROR_CODE",
      "message": "Description of the error."
    }
  }
  ```
- Log all exceptions with context for debugging.

### API Response Formats
- All successful responses should follow:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": { ... }
  }
  ```
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation.

### Database Model Patterns
- Use SQLAlchemy declarative models.
- Define relationships with explicit foreign keys and constraints.
- Use migrations (e.g., Alembic) for schema changes.

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all business logic and API endpoints.
- Use pytest as the testing framework.
- Achieve at least 80% code coverage.
- Include integration tests for service interactions.

## 3. Integration Specifications

### Service Communication Protocols
- RESTful HTTP for synchronous operations.
- WebSocket for real-time collaboration events.
- Use JSON as the standard data format.

### Authentication/Authorization Flow
- Use JWT tokens for authentication between services and clients.
- UserService issues and validates tokens.
- Role-based access control for document and collaboration permissions.
- Secure all endpoints with authentication middleware.

### Data Validation Requirements
- Validate all incoming data using Pydantic schemas.
- Enforce strict type and format checks for all fields.
- Return validation errors in the standard error format.

### Real-time Message Formats
- WebSocket messages should be JSON objects with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "event_type",
    "payload": { ... },
    "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp"
  }
  ```
- Support message types: `edit`, `cursor_move`, `user_join`, `user_leave`, `error`.

## 4. Quality Requirements

### Performance Expectations
- API response time < 200ms for 95% of requests.
- Real-time updates should propagate to all clients within 100ms.
- Use Redis caching for frequently accessed data.

### Security Requirements
- Enforce HTTPS for all external communication.
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Store passwords securely using strong hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

### Logging and Monitoring Standards
- Use structured logging (JSON format) for all services.
- Log all authentication attempts, errors, and critical actions.
- Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for metrics and alerting.

### Documentation Requirements
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Document all endpoints, request/response models, and error codes.
- Provide onboarding guides and architecture diagrams for developers.
