- Configuration management
- Sample data for testing
Generate production-ready code following the established patterns.

Step3:
Now add comprehensive security features and testing
1. Security Enhancements:

- Security headers and CORS configuration
- Audit logging for security events
- Password complexity requirements
- Session management with Redis
- Account lockout after failed attempts
2. Testing Suite:
- Unit tests for all authentication functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Security tests for common vulnerabilities
- Performance tests for concurrent users
3. Documentation:
- API documentation with examples
- Security implementation details
- Configuration guide
- Deployment instructions
*Generate all files needed for a complete, production-ready User Service.

---
Generate a complete Document Service following the system context and patterns established in the User Service.

can you make sure all the service are having proper port number and gateway. 
let me know do i need to run  docker or you will do it
