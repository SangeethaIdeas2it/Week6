# Architecture Design: AI-Powered E-Commerce Management System

## System Context
An online platform for product ordering, inventory management, and real-time customer interactions.

### Users & Actors
- **Customers**: Browse, order, and track products.
- **Admins/Managers**: Manage inventory, orders, and analytics.
- **AI Services**: Provide recommendations, insights, and automation.

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (Clean Architecture, .NET 8)
- **Real-time Communication**: SignalR (for live updates, notifications, order status)
- **Caching**: Redis (for fast data access, session, and distributed cache)
- **Database**: SQL Server (with Entity Framework Core for ORM)
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Redis Streams (for decoupled, scalable event processing)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for client-server communication
- **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized, scalable deployment)

### High-Level Interactions
- **Customers** interact with the system via web/mobile clients, making requests to the Web API.
- **Web API** handles business logic, validation, and orchestrates calls to the database, cache, and real-time services.
- **SignalR** provides real-time updates (e.g., order status, inventory changes) to connected clients.
- **Redis** is used for caching frequently accessed data and managing distributed sessions.
- **SQL Server** stores persistent data: products, orders, users, inventory, etc.
- **Redis Streams** enable event-driven workflows (e.g., order placed → inventory update → notification).
- **Admins** use management interfaces to update inventory, process orders, and view analytics.
- **AI Services** (optional extension) can plug into the event stream for recommendations, fraud detection, etc.

### Deployment Context
- All services are containerized using Docker.
- Docker Compose orchestrates multi-container setup (API, Redis, SQL Server, etc.).
- The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility following Clean Architecture principles.

## Requirements
- Product catalog (categories, pricing, inventory)
- Customer profiles and authentication
- Order management and payments
- Real-time stock updates
- Analytics dashboard

### Constraints
- Clean Architecture (.NET 8)
- Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
- SignalR for live updates
- Redis for caching and event handling

---

## Architectural Approaches

### 1. Monolithic Web API with Modules
**Core Services & Responsibilities:**
- All business logic (catalog, customers, orders, payments, analytics) in a single ASP.NET Core Web API project.
- Organized into modules/folders by domain.
- Shared infrastructure (EF Core, Redis, SignalR).

**Communication Patterns:**
- Internal module-to-module calls are in-process.
- External communication via REST API for clients.
- SignalR for real-time updates.
- Redis for caching and eventing (in-process event bus or mediator pattern).

**Scalability:**
- Deployed as a single unit (container or VM).
- Horizontally scalable by running multiple instances.
- Database and Redis can be scaled independently.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pros: Simple deployment, easy to develop/debug, no network overhead for internal calls, easier consistency.
- Cons: Can become complex as it grows, deployments affect the whole system, scaling is coarse-grained, harder to adopt new tech per module.

---

### 2. Layered Clean Architecture
**Core Services & Responsibilities:**
- Clean Architecture: Presentation (API), Application, Domain, Infrastructure layers.
- Each domain (Catalog, Orders, Customers, Analytics) is a separate project/namespace.
- Infrastructure (EF Core, Redis, SignalR) abstracted behind interfaces.

**Communication Patterns:**
- Layered: API → Application → Domain → Infrastructure.
- REST API for external clients.
- In-process events (domain events, mediators) for cross-domain communication.
- SignalR for real-time updates.
- Redis for caching and event-driven patterns.

**Scalability:**
- Deployed as a single application, but with clear separation of concerns.
- Horizontally scalable.
- Easier to test and maintain due to separation of layers and dependency inversion.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pros: Enforces separation of concerns, testability, maintainability, easier to refactor or extract services later, clear boundaries.
- Cons: Still a single deployable unit, some complexity in managing abstractions, not true isolation between domains, scaling is still at the app level.

---

### 3. Microservices with Domain Isolation
**Core Services & Responsibilities:**
- Each core domain (Catalog, Customers, Orders, Payments, Analytics) is a separate microservice.
- Each service owns its data and logic.
- Shared infrastructure (Redis, SignalR) for cross-service communication and real-time updates.

**Communication Patterns:**
- REST APIs for synchronous service-to-service and client communication.
- Event-driven (Redis Streams, Pub/Sub) for asynchronous workflows.
- SignalR hub(s) for real-time updates, possibly as a dedicated service.

**Scalability:**
- Each service can be scaled independently based on load.
- Enables polyglot persistence/technology if needed.
- Database per service (no direct cross-service DB access).

**Trade-offs:**
- Pros: High scalability, fault isolation, independent deployments, clear domain boundaries, easier to adopt new tech per service.
- Cons: Increased operational complexity, distributed data management, more complex debugging, higher initial setup cost.

## Selected Architecture: Layered Clean Architecture

### 1. Domain Structure
- **Entities:**
  - Product (Id, Name, Description, Price, Inventory, CategoryId, etc.)
  - Category (Id, Name, Description)
  - Customer (Id, Name, Email, Addresses, etc.)
  - Order (Id, CustomerId, OrderItems, Status, PaymentInfo, etc.)
  - OrderItem (ProductId, Quantity, Price)
- **Value Objects:**
  - Money (Amount, Currency)
  - Address (Street, City, State, Zip, Country)
  - Email (Value)
- **Domain Events:**
  - ProductCreated
  - InventoryChanged
  - OrderPlaced
  - OrderPaid
  - OrderShipped

### 2. Application Layer (CQRS)
- **Commands:**
  - CreateProductCommand, UpdateProductCommand, PlaceOrderCommand, UpdateInventoryCommand, etc.
- **Command Handlers:**
  - Handle business logic for each command, validate, raise domain events
- **Queries:**
  - GetProductByIdQuery, ListProductsQuery, GetOrderByIdQuery, etc.
- **Query Handlers:**
  - Read-optimized, can use projections or direct DB queries
- **MediatR** (or similar) for dispatching commands/queries/events

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- **EF Core:**
  - Implements repositories and Unit of Work for SQL Server
  - Handles migrations, seeding, and data access
- **Redis:**
  - Caching for products, inventory, sessions
  - Pub/Sub or Streams for event-driven updates (e.g., inventory changes)
- **Logging:**
  - Structured logging (Serilog, NLog, etc.)
  - Centralized log aggregation (e.g., ELK, Seq)

### 4. API Layer
- **RESTful Endpoints:**
  - CRUD for products, categories, customers, orders
  - Follows REST conventions, versioned APIs
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:**
  - Auto-generated API documentation and testing UI
- **SignalR:**
  - Real-time notifications for inventory changes, order status updates, admin dashboards

## Data Flow Example: Product Creation & Ordering

1. **Product Creation:**
   - API receives `CreateProductCommand` via REST endpoint
   - Command Handler validates and creates Product entity
   - ProductCreated domain event is raised
   - EF Core persists the new product
   - Redis cache is updated (if caching products)
   - SignalR notifies clients/admins of new product (if needed)

2. **Product Ordering:**
   - API receives `PlaceOrderCommand` via REST endpoint
   - Command Handler validates order, checks inventory
   - Order entity and OrderItems are created
   - InventoryChanged and OrderPlaced events are raised
   - EF Core persists order and updates inventory
   - Redis cache for inventory is updated
   - SignalR notifies clients of order status and inventory changes
   - Downstream services (e.g., analytics, email) can subscribe to events

---

## Real-Time Inventory Sync Strategy
- Inventory changes trigger `InventoryChanged` domain events
- Application layer publishes these events to Redis (Pub/Sub or Streams)
- SignalR hub subscribes to inventory events and pushes updates to connected clients (web, admin dashboard)
- Redis cache is updated for fast reads
- Optionally, use optimistic concurrency in EF Core to prevent race conditions

---

## Resilience and Retry Strategies
- **Database:**
  - Use EF Core retry policies for transient SQL errors
  - Transactions for critical operations (order placement, inventory update)
- **Redis:**
  - Retry logic for cache/event operations (e.g., Polly)
  - Fallback to DB if cache is unavailable
- **SignalR:**
  - Automatic reconnection for clients
  - Message buffering for missed updates
- **API:**
  - Global exception handling and meaningful error responses
  - Circuit breaker and timeout policies for external dependencies
- **Event Handling:**
  - Idempotent event handlers to avoid duplicate processing
  - Dead-letter queues for failed events (if using Streams)

---

### 2. Project Folder Structure (Sample)
```
/src
  /Api                # ASP.NET Core Web API (Presentation)
  /Application        # CQRS, business logic, interfaces
  /Domain            # Entities, value objects, domain events
  /Infrastructure    # EF Core, Redis, logging, external services
  /Shared            # Common utilities, base classes
/tests
  /UnitTests         # Unit tests for Application/Domain
  /IntegrationTests  # Integration tests for API/Infra
/docker              # Docker, Compose, deployment scripts
```

### 3. CQRS File Generation Plan
- **Commands:**
  - `/Application/Products/Commands/CreateProductCommand.cs`
  - `/Application/Orders/Commands/PlaceOrderCommand.cs`
- **Command Handlers:**
  - `/Application/Products/Handlers/CreateProductCommandHandler.cs`
  - `/Application/Orders/Handlers/PlaceOrderCommandHandler.cs`
- **Queries:**
  - `/Application/Products/Queries/GetProductByIdQuery.cs`
  - `/Application/Orders/Queries/GetOrderByIdQuery.cs`

### 4. Redis Caching and Events Plan
- **Caching:**
  - Use Redis for product, inventory, and session caching.
  - Implement cache-aside pattern in repositories/services.
  - Set appropriate TTLs and cache invalidation on updates.
- **Events:**
  - Use Redis Streams or Pub/Sub for domain events (e.g., InventoryChanged, OrderPlaced).
  - Application layer publishes events; subscribers (e.g., SignalR, analytics) consume and react.
  - Ensure idempotency and error handling in event consumers.

### 5. API Contract Guide
- **RESTful Design:**
  - Use resource-based URIs: `/api/products`, `/api/orders`, `/api/customers`
  - Standard HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
  - Consistent response envelopes (data, errors, metadata)
  - Use validation and meaningful error codes
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:**
  - Annotate controllers and models for auto-generation
  - Provide example requests/responses
- **SignalR:**
  - Define hub methods for real-time events (e.g., `InventoryUpdated`, `OrderStatusChanged`)
  - Document client/server message contracts

### 6. Testing and Deployment Plan
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests for domain logic, application handlers
  - Integration tests for API endpoints, database, Redis
  - End-to-end tests for critical flows (product order, inventory update)
  - Use test doubles/mocks for external dependencies
- **Deployment:**
  - Dockerize all services (API, Redis, SQL Server)
  - Use Docker Compose for local/dev orchestration
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy)
  - Monitoring/logging: integrate with ELK, Seq, or similar
