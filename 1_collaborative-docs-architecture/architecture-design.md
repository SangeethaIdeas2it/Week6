# Real-Time Collaborative Document Editing System: Architectural Approaches

## 1. Traditional Server-Based Approach

### Core Components & Responsibilities
- **Monolithic Application Server:** Handles all business logic, user sessions, document state, and synchronization.
- **Database:** Stores documents, user data, and version history.
- **WebSocket/HTTP Layer:** Manages real-time and standard communication with clients.
- **Authentication Module:** Manages user login and permissions.

### Real-Time Synchronization
- Clients connect to the server via WebSockets.
- All edits are sent to the server, which serializes and applies them to the document state.
- The server broadcasts updates to all connected clients.

### Scalability Characteristics
- Vertical scaling (bigger servers) is typical.
- Limited horizontal scaling; session stickiness or shared state is needed for multiple servers.
- Bottlenecks at the server for high concurrency.

### Implementation Complexity
- Simple to implement and reason about.
- Fewer moving parts, easier debugging.

### Trade-offs & Limitations
- **Pros:** Fast to build, easy to maintain for small teams, good for MVPs.
- **Cons:** Limited scalability, single point of failure, harder to scale for 1000+ concurrent users per document.

## 2. Event-Driven Microservices Approach

### Core Components & Responsibilities
- **API Gateway:** Routes requests to appropriate services.
- **Auth Service:** Handles authentication and authorization.
- **Document Service:** Manages document CRUD and versioning.
- **Collaboration Service:** Handles real-time editing and synchronization.
- **Event Bus (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ):** Decouples services, propagates events (edits, user actions).
- **Persistence Service:** Manages storage and retrieval of documents and history.

### Real-Time Synchronization
- Clients connect to the Collaboration Service via WebSockets.
- Edits are published as events to the event bus.
- Collaboration Service consumes events, updates document state, and broadcasts changes to clients.
- Other services (e.g., Persistence) subscribe to events for storage.

### Scalability Characteristics
- Services can be scaled independently based on load.
- Event bus enables high throughput and decoupling.
- Easier to handle 1000+ concurrent users per document.

### Implementation Complexity
- Higher complexity: requires orchestration, service discovery, and robust event handling.
- More challenging to debug and monitor.

### Trade-offs & Limitations
- **Pros:** Highly scalable, resilient, flexible for future features.
- **Cons:** Increased operational overhead, distributed system challenges (consistency, latency), requires expertise in microservices and event-driven design.

## Event-Driven Microservices: Detailed Architecture

### 1. Specific Services & Responsibilities
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests (REST & WebSocket). Routes requests, handles authentication tokens, and rate limiting.
- **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication (login, signup, OAuth), issues and validates JWT tokens, manages user roles and permissions.
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles, preferences, and metadata.
- **Document Service**: Handles CRUD operations for documents, manages document metadata (title, owner, collaborators), provides document listing and sharing features.
- **Collaboration Service**: Manages real-time editing sessions, receives and broadcasts document changes via WebSocket, applies conflict resolution logic, maintains in-memory state for active documents.
- **Event Bus (e.g., Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ)**: Decouples services by propagating events (edit, join, leave, save), ensures reliable delivery and ordering of events.
- **Persistence Service**: Listens to document change events, persists document changes, snapshots, and version history to the database.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications (email, in-app) for document sharing, comments, etc.
- **Audit/History Service**: Maintains a log of all changes for auditing and rollback.

### 2. Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous (Request/Response):**
  - API Gateway ↔ Auth Service (login, token validation)
  - API Gateway ↔ Document Service (CRUD, metadata)
  - API Gateway ↔ User Service (profile, preferences)
- **Asynchronous (Event-Driven):**
  - Collaboration Service ↔ Event Bus ↔ Persistence Service (document changes)
  - Collaboration Service ↔ Event Bus ↔ Notification/Audit Services (events)
  - Document Service ↔ Event Bus (document created, deleted, shared)
- **Real-Time (WebSocket):**
  - Client ↔ API Gateway ↔ Collaboration Service (edit events, presence, cursor position)

### 3. Data Flow for Real-Time Collaboration
1. User connects via WebSocket (through API Gateway) and joins a document session.
2. Edits are sent from the client to the Collaboration Service.
3. Collaboration Service:
   - Applies conflict resolution.
   - Broadcasts changes to all connected clients.
   - Publishes change events to the Event Bus.
4. Persistence Service consumes events and writes changes to the database.
5. Audit/History Service logs the change for versioning.
6. Notification Service may notify users of relevant events (e.g., new collaborator).

### 4. Technology Stack Recommendations
- **API Gateway:** Kong, NGINX, or custom Node.js/Express gateway
- **Auth Service:** Node.js/Express, Go, or Python (Flask/FastAPI) with JWT/OAuth2
- **User/Document/Collaboration Services:** Node.js (NestJS), Go, or Java (Spring Boot)
- **Event Bus:** Apache Kafka, NATS, or RabbitMQ
- **Persistence:** MongoDB (for document storage), PostgreSQL (for metadata), Redis (for in-memory state)
- **WebSocket:** Socket.IO (Node.js), ws, or native WebSocket libraries
- **Containerization/Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

### 5. Database Design Considerations
- **Document Storage:** Use a NoSQL DB (e.g., MongoDB) for flexible, nested document structures.
- **Metadata:** Store user, document, and sharing metadata in a relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **Versioning:** Store deltas/patches or full snapshots for each document version.
- **Indexes:** Index on document ID, user ID, and timestamps for fast retrieval.
- **Sharding:** Partition documents by document ID or user ID for scalability.

### 6. Conflict Resolution Strategy
- **Last-Write-Wins (LWW):** Simple but may lose intermediate changes.
- **Operational Transformation (OT):** Transform concurrent operations to maintain consistency.
- **CRDTs (if needed):** For more complex, decentralized scenarios.
- **Recommended:** Use OT or CRDT libraries in the Collaboration Service for robust conflict resolution.

### 7. Scalability & Performance Optimizations
- **Stateless Services:** Scale horizontally by running multiple instances.
- **Sharding:** Distribute documents across multiple database shards.
- **Caching:** Use Redis for hot document state and user sessions.
- **Backpressure:** Apply rate limiting and backpressure on WebSocket connections.
- **Event Bus Partitioning:** Use topic partitioning for high-throughput event processing.
- **Autoscaling:** Use Kubernetes HPA for dynamic scaling based on load.
- **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manage DB and WebSocket connections.

## 3. Modern Real-Time Architecture with Operational Transformation (OT)

### Core Components & Responsibilities
- **Real-Time Collaboration Server (OT Engine):** Implements OT algorithms, manages document state, resolves conflicts.
- **WebSocket Gateway:** Handles real-time connections and message routing.
- **Document Store:** Stores documents and version history, optimized for fast reads/writes.
- **Auth & Permissions Service:** Manages user access and roles.
- **Change Log/History Service:** Stores operation logs for auditing and undo/redo.

### Real-Time Synchronization
- Clients send operations (insert, delete, etc.) to the OT Engine via WebSockets.
- OT Engine transforms and merges operations to maintain consistency.
- Transformed operations are broadcast to all clients, ensuring everyone sees the same result.
- Operations are persisted for versioning and recovery.

### Scalability Characteristics
- OT Engine can be sharded by document, allowing horizontal scaling.
- Stateless WebSocket gateways can be scaled independently.
- Designed for high concurrency and low latency.

### Implementation Complexity
- High: Requires deep understanding of OT algorithms and distributed consistency.
- More complex to implement and test, but many open-source libraries exist.

### Trade-offs & Limitations
- **Pros:** Excellent real-time experience, strong consistency, supports massive concurrency.
- **Cons:** Steep learning curve, complex edge cases, requires careful design for sharding and failover.
